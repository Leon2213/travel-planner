# travel-planner
using graph traversal algorithm A-star, fastest routes between starting and end destination is calculated. Data is from Stockholms Lokaltrafik. With this implementation of A-star algorithm we can find the fastest route between two destinations based on data from a given day.<br>

The data from the selected day is stored in the "datafiles" folder. In the datafiles folder the name of the stations can be found aswell.
